\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To begin with, this first introductory Chapter should serve as an introduction
 to fracturing problems.
 The brief outline of the process, main challenges and ideas, as well as
 its real life significance are be outlined in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Literature-overview"

\end_inset

.
 Then the existing solutions for single fracture problems are reviewed in
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Single-Fracture-Model"

\end_inset

, and for more advanced multifracturing problems in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:aim_of_this_work"

\end_inset

.
 The text presented here should be interpreted as an overview of methods
 and results existing in the literature, and used to put the next Chapters
 in right context.
 Finally in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:aim_of_this_work"

\end_inset

 should lay out what this work is trying to achiebe

\begin_layout Chapter
PKN model reformulation 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "chap:PKN-model-reformulation"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first challenge of this work will be to reformulate the original PKN
 model formulation.
 Recently speed equation was reintroduced by Linkov 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Linkov_1"

\end_inset

, although it was originally used by Kemp 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kemp"

\end_inset

.
 Previously the majority of hydrofracturing problems were solved using finite
 volume methods, but thanks to the speed equation it is now possible to
 solve these using finite difference methods.
 Thous this chapter will make an attempt to provide the theoretical mathematical
 background upon which new finite difference based solutions can be later
 constructed.
 Hopes are that such a new formulation would not only be more straightforward,
 but would also lead to improved overall modeling of hydraulic fracture
 propagation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A large part of work presented in this Chapter was done with great mentoring
 from other research group members, as it repeats published article 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "moje_bzdury"

\end_inset

, and can be traced back to previous works 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MWL,Linkov_4"

\end_inset

 (and eventually back to the original model by Nordgren 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nordgren"

\end_inset

).
 It would be however impossible not to include these previous findings,
 without loosing essential prerequisite information, needed to understand
 the new formulation.
 The sections in this chapter achieve the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Preliminary-Results"

\end_inset

 is a general outline of background works on PKN model, with the previously
 known idea to use the crack tip asymptotics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Normalized-formulation"

\end_inset

 presents a new way to formulate the problem using fracture width 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 as the problem variable .
 This formulation is the first to the first asymptotic term directly (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "w_system"

\end_inset

).
 Furthermore a new simplification of carter law 
\lang english
( Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Carter-type-leak"

\end_inset

 )
\lang american
 is presented which can be used to ease leak off calculation, and further
 asymptotics terms beyond the second term are derived

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 reuses 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 variable formulation, bringing it in line with the other formulations of
 this chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 introduces a new variable
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

, and a new formulation compatible with previous 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 variable formulation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 explores the old speed equation related tip boundary condition 
\lang english
( Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 ), to introduce improved two term boundary condition ( Subsection

\begin_layout Standard
Having reformulated the classical PKN model in previous Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:PKN-model-reformulation"

\end_inset

 it is time to implement and test the new ideas.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This should begin by stiffness analysis shown in Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Stiffness-analysis"

\end_inset

.
 This will show that the reformulated PKN model is stiff, and therefore
 should be solved with appropriate stiff methods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The outline of numerical solution, done with proper stiff ODE methods, will
 be shown in Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Dynamic-systems-with"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The obtained numerical procedure will then be tested for reliability with
 various initial conditions 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 , 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
and accuracy

\end_inset

 against benchmark solutions shown Appendix
\lang english
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

.

\lang american
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It will be shown that using two terms of asymptotics allowed for much better
 accuracy, when compared to similar works that use only one term 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Comparison-with-known"

\end_inset

.
 As overall a large number of test would be done, these raised quite a number
 additional issues, not properly addressed by theoretical formulation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Solving these will allow to obtain problem specific further improvements
 in accuracy, as well as performance 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Having developed good and accurate methods for a single fracture, as derived
 in Chapter

, tested in Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, and published in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "moje_bzdury"

\end_inset

, the knowledge of single fracture will be now applied to simulate complex
 structures composed of multiple fractures.
 The PKN model will be used as a basis for this challenge, but this will
 require several significant changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang english
The main modification is going to be the replacement of simple linear elasticity
 relation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) with:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

 with these modified elasticity
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 will be updated:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q=-\frac{1}{M}w^{3}\frac{\partial p_{fluid}}{\partial x}=-\frac{1}{M}w^{3}\frac{\partial(p_{net}+\sigma_{o}+\sigma_{l})}{\partial x},\label{poiseulle_multi-1}

The term 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{o}$

\frac{\partial w}{\partial t}-\frac{1}{M}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(w^{3}\frac{\partial(kw+\sigma_{l})}{\partial x}\right)+q_{l}=0.\label{reynold_multi-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now one can see that this relatively small change in formulation to include
 the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{l}$
\end_inset

 is going to lead to much different formulation, for a single fracture,
 not to mention the additional work required to combine them into a system
 of multiple fractures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The description of this theoretical multifracturing model will be divided
 into five sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
First in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Formulation-of-2D"

\end_inset

 the main concept of what is understood as multifracturing formulation shall
 be explained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Next three Sections will cover particular solutions to joining fractures
 together 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
.It shall begin with relatively straightforward splitting of a single fracture
 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 against the known result.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the effects of elastic influence of multiple fractures will be analyzed
 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 As the problem gets more complex, so the actual code must be updated to
 handle new challenges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overview of software implementation designed reasonably handle all previousl
y introduced multifracturing features is shown in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
