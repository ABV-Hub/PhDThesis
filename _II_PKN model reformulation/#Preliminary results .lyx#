 in context of this thesis.
 Consider a symmetrical crack of the length 
\begin_inset Formula $2l$
\end_inset

 situated in the plane 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in(-l,l)$
\end_inset

, where the length 
\begin_inset Formula $l=l(t)$
\end_inset

 is one of the solution components changing as a result of fluid flow inside
 the crack.
 The initial crack length is assumed to be nonzero: 
\begin_inset Formula $l(0)=l_{*}>0$
\end_inset

.
 By convention, the crack is fully filled by a Newtonian liquid injected
 at some known rate 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}(t)$
\end_inset

 at the crack mouth 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

.

The Poiseulle equation for the Newtonian liquid flow in a narrow channel
 is written in the form: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q=-\frac{1}{M}w^{3}\frac{\partial p_{net}}{\partial x},\label{poiseulle}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $q=q(t,x)$
\end_inset

 is the fluid flow rate and 
\begin_inset Formula $w=w(t,x)$
\end_inset

 is the crack opening, while 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{net}=p_{net}(t,x)$
\end_inset

 is the net fluid pressure, that is, the difference between the fluid pressure
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{fluid}$

 is assumed to be uniform over the entire fracture length, but this assumption
 will challenged in the following Chapters
\end_layout

 The constant 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 involved in the equation is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $M=12\mu$

The continuity equation, accounting for the crack expansion and the leak-off
 of the fluid is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial w}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial q}{\partial x}+q_{l}=0,\quad t>0,\quad0<x<l(t),\label{continuity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{l}=q_{l}(t,x)$
\end_inset

 is the volume rate of fluid loss to formation in the direction perpendicular
 to the crack propagation direction (
\begin_inset Formula $x$

-axis).

Although the definition of leak-off as the volume of fluid lost to the surroundi
ng medium is well defined, the choice of function that describes this quantity
 is subject to further interpretation.
 Indeed various works choose to use different functions to represent this
 physical phenomena 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kovalyshen_phd,Nordgren,Kresse2,MWL"

\end_inset

, so a sensible choice is to consider multiple possible representations
 and be able to switch these in the model.
 In this work the following leak-off versions are be considered: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q_{l}(t,x)=q_{l}^{(j)}(t,x)+q_{j}^{*}(t,x),\quad j=1,2,3,\label{leak-off}

Finally, by consecutive integration of equation

It has been shown in

 defined in the following manner:

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
l'(t)=V\left(t,l(t)\right),\quad t>0.\label{velocity_2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Moreover, for physical reasons, one can deduce that the fluid velocity at
 the crack tip is finite 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
0\le V\left(t,x\right)<\infty,\quad t>0,\quad x\le l(t)\label{velocity_b}

Note that, allowing the crack propagation speed to be infinite, one has
 to simultaneously include the inertia term in the equations

There is no mass involved, hence no inertia term

 slow by nature.

 Thus, the estimate (

 However, as shown in

 , proper usage of fluid velocity may be extremely beneficial.
 First, it allows one to replace two boundary conditions at the crack tip
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "boundary_conditions"

\end_inset

) with a single one additionally incorporating information from the speed
 equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "velocity_b"

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, the boundary conditions (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "boundary_conditions"

\end_inset

) in view of (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "poiseulle"

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "elasticity"

\end_inset

) lead to the estimate 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w(t,x)=o\left((l(t)-x)^{\frac{1}{4}}\right),\quad x\rightarrow l(t),\label{w_asym_0}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which does not necessarily guarantee (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "velocity_b"

\end_inset

).
 However, further analysis of the problem, for different leak-off functions
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kovalyshen,Kemp"

\end_inset

 and Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-details-of"

\end_inset

), shows that the particle velocity is bounded near the crack tip and the
 crack opening exhibits the following asymptotic behavior:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}w(t,x)=w_{0}(t)\big(l(t)-x\big)^{\frac{1}{3}}+w_{1}(t)\big(l(t)-x\big)^{\alpha}+\, o\big((l(t)-x)^{\alpha}\big),\\
 & x\rightarrow l(t),
\end{split}
\label{w_asym_1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with some 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>1/3$
\end_inset

.
 For the classical PKN model for an impermeable solid (or when leak-off
 vanishes near the crack tip at least as fast as the crack opening) the
 exponent 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=4/3$
\end_inset

 was found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kemp"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MWL"

\end_inset

.
 For the case of the singular Carter's type leak-off, the exponent 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1/2$
\end_inset

 was determined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kovalyshen"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the asymptotics 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "w_asym_1"

\end_inset

 shows that fluid velocity is indeed bounded near the crack tip.
 Moreover, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V(t,x)=V_{0}(t)+V_{1}(t)\big(l(t)-x\big)^{\beta}+o\big((l(t)-x)^{\beta}\big),\label{V_asym_0}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

as 
\begin_inset Formula $x\to l(t)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\alpha-1/3$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{0}=\frac{k}{3M}w_{0}^{3}(t),\quad V_{1}=\frac{k}{M}\left(\alpha+\frac{2}{3}\right)w_{0}^{2}(t)w_{1}(t).\label{V_asym_0_coefs}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

As follows from Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-details-of"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $V(t,x)$
\end_inset

 may not be so smooth near the crack tip as one could expect and the exponent
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "V_asym_0"

\end_inset

) plays an important role for this.
 Indeed, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\ge1$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $V(t,\cdot)\in C^{1}[0,l(t)]$
\end_inset

 and the particle velocity function is smooth enough near the crack tip.
 However, this happens only in the special case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=4/3$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{x}(t,x)$
\end_inset

 is bounded near the crack tip.
 In case of singular leak-off (
\begin_inset Formula $0<\beta<1$
\end_inset

), the particle velocity near the crack tip is only of the Hölder type 
\begin_inset Formula $V(t,\cdot)\in C^{1}[0,l(t))\bigcap H^{\beta}[0,l(t)]$
\end_inset

.
 In Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-details-of"

\end_inset

 the exact form of the asymptotic expansion 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "w_asym_1"

\end_inset

 is presented, which yields the aforementioned smoothness deterioration
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 near the crack tip for the singular leak-off models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that estimate 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This discussion clearly illustrates why accounting for asymptotic behavior
 of the solution in form

 is of crucial importance for effective numerical realization of any algorithm

 On the other hand, the fact that the particle velocity function is smooth
 enough near the crack tip has been one of the important arguments to use

the speed equation and proper variable approach

 as the basis for improvement of the existing numerical algorithms

 It should be emphasized that behavior of

 near the crack tip may have serious implications when using

-regularization technique (Section

 Therefore, the one of the aims of this work is show that, regardless of
 possible smoothness of the particle velocity near the crack tip, the approach
 proposed in
