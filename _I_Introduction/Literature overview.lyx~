\begin_layout Standard
To begin, lets start with a brief explanation of what hydrofracturing is,
 and why it was created.
 Natural gas and oil have been the main fossil fuels in use for the past
 century.
 These were initially extracted from conventional deposits, underground
 pockets of trapped hydrocarbons.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "gas_picture"

\end_inset

 shows various types of oil and gas reservoirs, where an example of conventional
 gas and oil deposits are shown.
 These deposits were relatively easy to access, when a rig was drilled the
 pressure would often force a violate burst of stored fossil fuel.
 A very accurate (but over dramatic) cinematization of these early days
 oil industry could even be seen in a number of Hollywood productions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "there_will_be_blood"

\end_inset

.
 Even in the recent history there are examples of oil and gas uncontrollably
 forcing its way to the surface: Kuwait 1991, Gulf of Mexico 2010 or Nefteyugans
k 2015, to name just a few major ones.
 It could be mistaken that extraction of liquid fossil fuels is just about
 capturing this uncontrollable flow of a free natural resource.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, in reality oil and gas acquisition is a complex multiphysics
 problem.
 In an attempt to introduce the overall complexity, lets begin with pressure,
 porosity and permeability.
 The deeper underground we go the higher the formation pressure, at depths
 of a few kilometers the weight of the above material will add up to a multitude
 of the atmospheric pressure.
 Porosity is a measure of how much of a rock is open space, a proportion
 of pores to solid matter, and even at these great depths, there pores might
 be filled with some hydrocarbonate fluid.
 Finally permeability is a measure of the ease with which a fluid (oil or
 gas) can move through a porous rock.
 A conventional reservoir would therefore be made of a filled porous rock,
 such as sandstone, covered by some other impermeable rock layer.
 The drilled well would create a path that would direct a pressure driven
 viscous flow of oil or gas to the surface, which could be modeled by Darcy's
 Law

.
 These type of reservoirs are still operational, and contribute the major
 part of world oil and gas production, however many are depleted or running
 dry.

The output of conventional oil and gas fields could have been described
 by Hubbert Curve 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, a model that assumes a peek in production followed by a steady decline.
 In the US (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "oil_peak_fig"

\end_inset

) these maximum production output appeared to occur in the 1970s.
 Therefore as known techniques of hydrocarbons extraction were proving to
 be insufficient, efforts to find new ways of obtaining oil were made.
 The first pioneering papers on the topic of hydrofracturing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Crittendon,Geertsma,Harrison,Hubbert,Khristianovic,Nordgren,Perkins,SS"

\end_inset

 were published during that peek production time, as the industry realized
 the need to use new, unconventional methods of hydrocarbon recovery to
 meet the growing supply.

 A typical hydrofracturing fracturing job, as shown on Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fracking_scheme"

\end_inset

, could be done in the following stages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Drilling of a vertical well, or preparation of an existing one if stimulating
 depleted reservoir.
 The wells walls must be prepared to withstand massive pressures without
 unanticipated leak to the ground waters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Drilling of a long horizontal section that spans throughout target resource
 rich rock formation, which could be some gas rich shale as shown on Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 It is a fairly recent technique that requires proper horizontal drilling
 heads.

\begin_layout Itemize
Preparation of initial fractures with directed explosive charges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pumping of fracturing fluid.
 This could go on for days, and requires substantial reserves of water,
 chemical additives, and powerful pumps

Mixing in proppant.
 This hard solid additive spreads inside fractures and prevents them from
 closing, after pumping is stopped.
 Sand, or other granulate material such as ceramic grains can be used, provided
 it is hard enough to hold drained fracture walls opened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
And finally moving on to production phase, capturing hydrocarbons that flow
 out of the created fractures.

The process is indeed very sophisticated and expensive, but pays off.
 Due to its application, the Hubbert Curve has been beaten

 and the popularized in the mass media forecast of fossil fuel depletion
 appears to be postponed for the next century.
 Indeed over the past decade natural gas production in the US alone increased
 by over 50% 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 due to the recent shale gas boom.
 This was achieved by widespread application of hydrofracturing.
 Shale gas deposits, as opposed to conventional sandstones, have natural
 gas trapped in pores of non permeable shale formations (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "gas_picture"

\end_inset

 again).
 Hydrofracturing, pumping fluid under extremely high pressures opens new
 fractures, and creates pathways for the natural gas to escape these pores
 in shale and flow all the way to the surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This work should cover only a single stage of the hydrofracturing process,
 the numerical modeling of fracture propagation due to fluid pumping.
 Although it is only a single stage of this large multiphysics problem,
 modeling fracture propagation is already a sufficient enough challenge
 on its own to produce interesting and novel research.
 The previous physical concepts: pressure, porosity and permeability of
 the reservoir will now be coupled with incompressible viscous fluid dynamics,
 fracture mechanics and complex non static geometries into a dynamic mathematica
l model.
 This will cover the evolution of short initial fractures located right
 at the drilled wellbore, to an underground system of multiple fractures,
 that could span over several kilometers.
 The engineering and geological challenges of choosing right drilling place,
 preparing a sufficient horizontal well at depths of up to a few kilometers,
 and maintaining later production will not be covered here.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of proppant mixing and transportation, that follows immediately
 after the stage of fracture propagation will not be mentioned here.
 Taking proppant into consideration would introduce even more physical propertie
s and processes, which would extend the overall complexity beyond manageable
 level.
 Even the oldest and relatively simple proppant model by Einstein 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Einstein"

\end_inset

, might not describe the actual physical process correctly 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kuzkin"

\end_inset

, but would make fluid viscosity dependent on proppant concentration, thus
 add yet another variable.
 Furthermore other thermal and chemical processes would need to be taken
 care of as these also affect fluid viscosity, therefore it is reasonable
 to exclude these and simply assume uniform constant viscosity of fracturing
 fluid.
