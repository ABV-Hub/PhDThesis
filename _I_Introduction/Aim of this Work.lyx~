\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far this introduction Chapter has shown the economic motivation behind
 hydrofracturing, the techniques for single fracture modeling, and the attempts
 to model more complex reservoirs with multi fracture models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reservoir stimulation can be an expensive and uncertain task.
 Choosing the right place to drill, and performing the fracturing properly,
 is hard and without adequate planning the whole enterprise is very likely
 to fail.
 The industry attempts to eliminate this risk by developing computer models
 that predict what the results might be.
 Thou this work will attempt to make yet another prototype model that answers
 a part of more general question: will this well produce any oil or gas
 ?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The answer is however not a simple yes or no, but rather a combination of
 if multiple results, where each of them carries a piece of information.
 The single fracture models mentioned in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Single-Fracture-Model"

\end_inset

 give a prediction about how deeply the rock formations can be penetrated.
 This does not tell much about the cost, risks or result production, but
 provides one piece of the puzzle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This work should concentrate on exploring the existing models and finding
 their applications which can be generalized in 4 main tasks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Studying the PKN model of a single fracture, and attempting to improve its
 theoretical formulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Implementing code that can efficiently handle one fracture problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Extending the single fracture formulation into multiple fracture formulation,
 multifracturing, that can handle more complex problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Building a software solution, that utilizes all this new ideas, to model
 the process of hydraulic fracture growth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of the above have been attempted a number of times, and so numbers of
 solutions exist.
 However all the solutions are different in accuracy, performance, applicability
, scalability and even availability.
 Thus the work here does not outright seek to produce better result, but
 rather an alternative that uses different methods and approaches to produce
 different, yet compatible solutions, that are freely available for others
 to use
