\begin_layout Standard
So far traditional models assumed single fractures.
 Although these worked fine for reservoir treatment planing for decades,
 and were verified through some simple experiments 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "experimental,experimental2"

\end_inset

, these are rather simplified best guesses rather than actual understanding
 of what is happening underground.
 The classical models could relay be trying to mimic systems of multiple
 fractures 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, that under favorable circumstances could form a single dominant fracture.
 Meanwhile a number of other technologies were developed to aid and monitor
 treatments process.
 These included microcosmic mapping, detecting minor seismic activity associated
 with fracture front movement 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cipolla"

\end_inset

, and surface displacement detection

\end_inset

.
 As more and more fracturing data became available attempts to include these
 in the simulations were made, unfortunately single fracture models could
 not account o

The study of reservoirs geology reveals that the previous uniform medium
 assumption is not very accurate.
 In reality rock formations are far from being perfect two dimensional mediums,
 a number of defects should be included such as pre-existing natural fractures,
 especially in shale rich formations that are of great interest 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lash"

\end_inset

.
 These natural preexisting fractures should have effect on propagating hydraulic
 fractures, possibly resulting in new hydraulic fractures being opened 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kresse2,Zhang"

\end_inset

.
 Before the treatment, the naturally exiting fractures alone form a discreet
 fracture network 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "DFN_1,Chaoshui_XU"

\end_inset

, and it should be expected that the treatment will not produce a perfect
 single fracture, but rather be influenced by these preexisting fractures.
 Furthermore to optimize the hydrofracturing process a number of fractures
 is initiated simultaneously 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Dusseault,Bunger"

\end_inset

, to achieve grater coverage of the fractured reservoir.
 Therefore in order to make more accurate model one needs to take account
 for multiple fractures, build a more complex model based on theoretical
 single fracture models.

While a single simple non P3D fracture propagation is relativity easy to
 compute with proper usage of implicit methods and numerical formulation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Adachi_2007"

\end_inset

, to improve on these to a multifracture model is a much more complex challenge.
 The mathematical formulation must be extended to account for any fractures
 interactions, while the performance should not be drastically affected
 by multiplying the problem size.
 On top of that the effort required to handle and display data is much grater
 when more than one fracture is considered.
 These factors alone should be accounted for the variety of hydrofracturing
 models that appeared over the few past years, that are capable of dealing
 with multiple fractures.

To list a few example solutions, lets first begin with the model given by
 Ghani 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ghani"

\end_inset

.
 It is a relatively straightforward solution that allows for a hydraulic
 fracture to propagate freely in a inhomogeneous discretization of 2D plane,
 depicted Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "ghani_model"

\end_inset

.
 Other solutions however tend to put much stricter restrains on fracture
 path and shape.
 The influence on nearby fractures can result in shadowing, dampened propagation
 of certain fractures.
 These effects are observable in some solutions, including the most recent
 ones by Bunger 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Bunger_multi"

\end_inset

.
 The most developed models available, are actually commercial software used
 by oil consulting companies, such as Schlumberger (works of KRasse and
 Weng

key "Kresse1,Kresse2,Cipolla"

) or Itasca (Damjanac

), which attempt to produce comprehensive simulation of treatment process.

 Additionally the source code of these solutions is not publicly available,
 nor any free licenses.
 These leaves an open space for new solutions which are thoroughly tested
 in terms of accuracy, are based on some reliable formulations, and are
 given away for freeware usage.
