The computational challenges of these models result from several factors:

\begin_layout Itemize
strong non-linearity introduced by the Poiseuille equation describing the

in the general case, a non-local relationship between the fracture opening

The first numerical solution by Nordgren 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nordgren"

\end_inset

 was based on a few assumptions.
 The shape of crack was assumed to be elliptical as a possible solution
 of plain strain equation.
 Rock toughness and fluid lag at the crack tip was ignored.
 Carter law 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Carter"

\end_inset

, a simplified one dimensional formula, was chosen to govern fluid leak-off.
 This resulted in PKN formulation being a relatively simple model, that
 allowed to predict single fractures under certain conditions, but many
 questions about its accuracy and properties arise over past years.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The initial crack length was assumed to be nonzero: 
\begin_inset Formula $l(0)=l_{*}>0$
\end_inset

 .
 For the initial stage of crack propagation inertia term should to be included,
 thus all classical model that do include inertia would not be credible
 anyway.
 But this simplification can be justified as hydrofracturing process might
 begin from already existing fractures, naturally present or artificially
 created with directed charges 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The reasoning behind zero tougheners (
\begin_inset Formula $K_{IC}=0$
\end_inset

) is that the resistance of propagation medium is so small, that the energy
 dissipated by the fracture extension is negligible compared to the energy
 dissipated in the viscous fluid flow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Adachi_2002"

\end_inset

, moreover in
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sav_det_2002"

\end_inset

 it has been proven that 
\emph on
radial hydraulic fractures in impermeable rocks generally propagate in the
 viscosity regime

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 where the fracture height is also a part of the problem.
 These take into account that a fracture can propagate through multiple
 layers of medium of different properties.

Significant improvements to PKN model were introduced by Kemp in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kemp"

\end_inset

.
 Asymptotic analysis of the solution near the crack tip for impermeable
 medium model was presented as well as an approximate solution for the zero
 leak-off case, with accuracy to the first four leading asymptotic terms.
 Here, probably for the first time, the speed equation was efficiently implement
ed in the model.
 The fourth degree of the crack opening was considered as the proper variable
 and used in the numerical computations.
 Finally Kemp suggested to use a special tip element, compatible with the
 asymptotic behavior of the solution, within the Finite Volume (FV) scheme.

\begin_layout Standard
It should be noticed that a major part of existing publications can be linked
 to the University of Minnesota 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Among publications produced there the work done by Kovalyshen 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kovalyshen,Kovalyshen_phd"

\end_inset

 which introduced further improvements to PKN model over previous works.
 Extension of the zero leak off solution 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 to the full series representation was then given by Kovalyshen 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 For the leak-off function defined by the Carter law the two leading terms
 of asymptotics were found, and to take into account the multi-scale arguments
 suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Garagashetal"

\end_inset

.
 However FV scheme with special tip element was again used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This trend to use FV based methods was questioned by Linkov in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Linkov_1"

\end_inset

 where the speed equation was reintroduced.
 This concept was indirectly presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "SS"

\end_inset

 and utilized by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kemp"

\end_inset

, but later abandoned.
 Linkov discovered that the hydraulic fracture problem may exhibit ill posed
 properties, and to eliminate this problem a number of techniques were proposed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
speed equation to trace the crack front instead of the usually applied total
 flux balance condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the so-called 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

-regularization technique which consists of imposing the computational domain
 boundary at a small distance behind the crack tip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
new boundary condition to be imposed in the regularized formulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
new dependent variables: the particle velocity and the crack opening taken
 in a degree to exploit the asymptotic behavior of the solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the spatial coordinates moving with the crack front and evaluation of the
 temporal derivative under fixed values of these coordinates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sparkled a series of publications redefining the conventional approach
 to the PKN model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Linkov_4,Linkov_2,Linkov_3,MWL,Spectral,dupny_universal,moje_bzdury"

\end_inset

 where Finite Differences method were used to deal with governing PDEs.
 Initially it was shown that for the case of leak-off vanishing near the
 crack tip a great improvement over previous methods can be achieved by
 using a proper form of boundary condition and a modified dependent variable
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "MWL"

\end_inset

.
 Then the paper 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "moje_bzdury"

\end_inset

, that is integrated as a part of this work, proved that also in the case
 of singular Carter law

\end_inset

 leak off the suggestions of Linkov are very beneficial.
 Other works in this series 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 sought to use more promising numerical algorithms, and apply this strategies
 to the KGD model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The context of single hydraulic models and their development was described.
 This should be treated as a brief overview that outlines most important
 issues and challenges.
 For further reading there is a number of intoroductory publications on
 both theoretical and numerical aspects of single hydraulic fracture models
 such as:

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 that start at the fundamental level of non hydraulic fracture mechanics
 and build up to the formulation to present these single fracture models.
