Extra tests on carter law 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Test with known 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}^{*}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An additional test can be performed using the general analytical benchmark
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:General-benchmark"

\end_inset

, which mimics the behavior of the problem with Carter Law leak off type.
 The leak off 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "leak-off"

\end_inset

 can be split in to two terms: 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{l}^{(j)}(t,x)$
\end_inset

 based on Carter law and supplementary 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}^{*}(t,x)$
\end_inset

.
 Since in the benchmarks the exact value of 
\begin_inset Formula $q(t,x)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "q_l_bench"

\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(x)=L^{-1}(x)$
\end_inset

 required for 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{l}^{(j)}(t,x)$
\end_inset

 , is know, the term 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}^{*}$
\end_inset

 can also be found as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q_{j}^{*}(t,x)=q_{l}(t,x)-q_{l}^{(j)}(t,x)\label{q_star}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So if the analytical benchmark 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:General-benchmark"

\end_inset

 is limited in to the two terms its components 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "w_bench"

\end_inset

-
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "q_l_bench"

\end_inset

 it can be worked out that 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{l}^{(1)}(t,x)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "carter"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
can be substituted in to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "q_star"

\end_inset

 to obtain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}q_{1}^{*}(t,x)= & W_{0}(a+t)^{\gamma-1}\Bigg[(3\gamma+1)\Big(\frac{7}{8}W_{1}(1-x)^{-\frac{1}{2}}+\frac{5}{2}W_{1}^{2}(1-x)^{-\frac{1}{3}}\\
 & +\frac{55}{24}W_{1}^{3}(1-x)^{-\frac{1}{6}}+\frac{3}{4}W_{1}^{4}(1-x)^{0}\Big)+\frac{1}{6}(1-3\gamma)(1-x)^{\frac{1}{3}}+\\
 & +\frac{1}{4}(1-\gamma)W_{1}(1-x)^{\frac{1}{2}}\Bigg]-\frac{1}{\sqrt{t-L^{-1}(x)}},
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The term 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{l}^{(j)}(t,x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{t-L^{-1}(x)}}$
\end_inset

 can also be supplied analytically, by inverting the known fracture length
 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 from benchmark 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "v_bench"

\end_inset

, or found numerically using a numerical procedure for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(x)=L^{-1}(x)$
\end_inset

 described in Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Exposure-time-computation"

\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $C(t)$
\end_inset

 is set to one).
 This means a test that measures the effect of numerical leak off approximation
 can be constructed.
 While no analytical solution for transient regime for Cartel Law leak off
 exist, the benchmark solution can serve as a relatively close counterpart.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 variable system can be slightly modified such so the known 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{l}^{*}$
\end_inset

 term is provided and only the remaining 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{l}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 term is to be found numerical.
 In other words the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "w_DS"

\end_inset

 is slightly modified to include two leak off terms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial w}{\partial t}=\frac{1}{L^{2}(t)}\left[\frac{1}{3}w_{0}^{3}x\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}+3x^{2}\left(\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\right)^{2}+w^{3}\frac{\partial^{2}w}{\partial x^{2}}\right]-q_{l}^{(1)}-q_{1}^{*}.\label{w_system_q_star}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This gives us some settings to test the accuracy of the method for computing
 leak off itself, and indirectly the accuracy of the transient solution.
 Lets use the leak off numerical 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 approximation as proposed in Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Exposure-time-computation"

\end_inset

 and compute the system two times, one time with analytical and fully known
 leak off, and one time with numerical approximation of 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{l}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 added to the known analytical part 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, the idea is construct a specific example which serves as
 a middle ground between testing against known analytical and the unknown
 transient solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results are shown on Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "q_star_test"

\end_inset

.
 Interestingly regardless of the method used to compute leak off function
 the accuracy remains unchanged.
 The computation time, and number of time steps required is affected.
 Numerical approximation triggers the solver to make more time steps.
 Note that this essential binds the maximum time step to the propagation
 speed.
 While the fracture opening 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 and fracture length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 apparently become predictable after a number of successful time steps,
 the numerical approximation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(x)$
\end_inset

 for each grid point prevents the solver from increasing the time steps
 infinitely.
 Numerical inversion of 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{-1}$
\end_inset

 based on an interpolation of previously computed time steps will eventually
 produce less accurate result if the time step becomes too large, that is
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(x)$
\end_inset

 is guesstimated on history points that are too far away.
 This means that the strategy shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Spectral"

\end_inset

, and any publication that follows, where the time step grows 
\emph on
exponentially, 
\emph default
will require a new time step strategy or much more sophisticated leak off
 computation algorithm than the one presented here, if the leak off is to
 be computed as a part of the unknown solution rather than simply artificially
 analytically provided.
 On the other hand the test shown here was relatively straightforward to
 set up, as conventional ODE solvers are capable of effectively managing
 the time step themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless this tests proves that Carter leak off can be accurately computed
 numerically, and suggests that the numerical accuracy is unaffected by
 the leak off approximation used in this work.

\begin_layout Subsection
Remarks on the sensitivity of the Carter leak-off model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is well known that applicability of the empirical Carter law (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "carter"

\end_inset

) in the vicinity of the fracture tip is questionable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Economides2000,Kovalyshen_phd,MKP"

\end_inset

 Moreover, when combining Carter leak off with some non-local variants of
 elasticity models (for example, KGD model of hydrofracturing), one obtains
 an infinite particle velocity at the crack tip.
 As a result, the speed equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "velocity_2"

\end_inset

) cannot be applied in such a case.
 One way to eliminate this unwanted behavior is to assume that the Carter
 law becomes valid only at some distance away from the fracture tip (see
 for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MKP"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PKN model, which does not exhibit such a drawback, gives an opportunity
 to assess how the solution is affected by a modification of the classical
 Carter law in the neighborhood of the fracture tip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, lets consider two modifications.
 The first assumes that leak-off function equals zero over some distance
 from the crack front (
\begin_inset Formula $d>\varepsilon$
\end_inset

).
 The second uses a constant value of 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{l}$
\end_inset

 in the same interval.
 This value is chosen to maintain continuity of the leak-off function.
 Note, that both of these modifications change the volume of fluid loss
 to the rock formation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relative deviations of the crack lengths for these modifications from
 the original one are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "dev_carter"

\end_inset

.
 Results for two values of 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $d=\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $d=10\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 (for 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon=10^{-5}$
\end_inset

) are displayed.
 The symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{ld}$
\end_inset

 in the legend refers to the cases when the leak-off function is complimented
 by the constant value over 
\begin_inset Formula $1-d\leq x\leq1$
\end_inset

.
 One can deduce that the maximal relative discrepancies (up to 1%) appear
 at the initial and large times.
 To explain this phenomenon, lets evaluate the additional volume of fluid
 retained in the fracture as a result of the modification to Carter law
 .
 Taking into account (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "f_D"

\end_inset

), these values are 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta Q_{l}(t)=2D(t)\sqrt{d}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta Q_{l}(t)=D(t)\sqrt{d}$
\end_inset

, for the respective modifications (see (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "function_D"

\end_inset

) for 
\begin_inset Formula $D(t)$
\end_inset

).
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $D(t)=\sqrt{u(t)/t}$
\end_inset

 represents deviation for the small time.
 For large time, the effect of accumulation of the difference of the fluid
 loss, 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{t}\Delta Q_{l}(\tau)d\tau$
\end_inset

 = 
\begin_inset Formula $O(\sqrt{td})$
\end_inset

, plays the crucial role.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above test proves that the application of Carter law modified in the
 aforementioned ways, is fully justified when one considers the accuracies
 required in the practical applications.
