Formulation of 2D multifracturing problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets start by assuming that we can represent the whole complex physical
 underground process of manufacturing to be simulated by some 
\emph on
good enough 
\emph default
model.
 By saying so it is ment that the goal is not to make the most accurate
 possible abstraction, but rather one that is simple and reliable, yet produces
 in resoanable time results of acceptable accuracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having developed methods for single fracure, the knowledge can be now applied
 to simulate complex structures composed of multiple fractures simulated
 in the same manner.
 One could make an argument about applicability of PKN model for this idea,
 as it was designed specificly for handling just one fracture scenario.
 This indeed means violation of some underlying assumptions.
 However with the revelant updates to the orginal formulation the outcome
 of such an experimnet will be proved to be quite 
\emph on
good enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(I suppose my supervisor can suport this concept much better, it was not
 my idea to make PKN based hydrofracturing)

 It exists in two dimensional plane with Cartesian coordinate system and
 consequently a number of special points

 elasticity and Poiseuille law.
 Such a crack is attached to a

 This equation has much better behaviour than the previous crack problem,
 as the fracture tip and its singularity is no longer exist.
 Just like in previous case proper dependent variables can be introduced:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial U}{\partial t}=\frac{k}{3ML^{2}}\left[\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}\right)^{2}+3U\frac{\partial^{2}U}{\partial x^{2}}\right]-3U^{\frac{2}{3}}q_{l}\label{pipe_reynolds_U}

At least one eadge should be connected, but there should be no restriction
 made on the maximum number (or at least there is no need to impose limits
 at this stage).
 If we assume that the size of a 
\shape italic
junction
\shape default
 itself is small enough, compared to the dimensions of connected eadges,
 and that these width is relatively small compered to length, it is plausable
 to be modeled 
\emph on

 For such a point we would expect a single value of pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\mathcal{J}(t)$
\end_inset

, and fluid balance of flow through that point to be zero.
 Therefore within one

 it is assumed that:

\begin_inset Formula $w$

, we can down flow rate as related to pressure, for cracks and pipe cracks
 :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q=-\frac{k}{ML}w^{3}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}=\frac{1}{MLk^{3}}p^{3}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\label{flow to pressure}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to play around with the following, say use other known data
 points of adjected objects to make some numerical approximation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}$
\end_inset

 depending on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 at the junction.
 Using some finite differences, polynomial interpolation or other linear
 transformation to approximate the 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}$
\end_inset

 term with such values of constants 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 can be written as the following nonlinear relationship:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q=\frac{1}{MLk^{3}}p^{3}\left(\alpha p+\beta\right)\label{flow to pressure}

Furthermore if we multiply constants 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{MLk^{2}}$
\end_inset

 we can see that one of the components of the sums of flows 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

q_{i}=\alpha p^{4}+\beta p^{3}\label{flow sum component}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Let use the following parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 to replace fixed length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and radius 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 of such a pipe: 
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p=(p-p_{other})$
\end_inset

 , where the pressure given by the other junction connected by a solid pipe
 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{other}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore a solid pipe attached to a junction would result in the following
 component of for flow sum:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q_{i}=\gamma p-\gamma p_{other}\label{flow sum component pipe}

Now lets say there is some

 number of connected 
\shape italic
Cracks
\shape default
, 
\shape italic

\shape default
 or 
\shape italic
Solid Pipes
\shape default
.
 To find the pressure in such a junction one would need to find the root
 of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f(p,p_{other})=\sum_{i}^{n}q_{i}=\sum_{i}^{n}\alpha_{i}p^{4}+\sum_{i}^{n}\beta_{i}p^{3}+\sum_{i}^{n}\gamma_{i}p-\sum_{i}^{n}p_{other}^{(i)}+q_{0}\label{pressure root function}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}$
\end_inset

 would be obtained form each adjected object (zero value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}$
\end_inset

\shape italic
Cracks

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 for 
\shape italic
Solid Pipe
\shape default
).
 Some extra fluid pumping can be added to the balance by 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 This expression assumes that the flow can be in fact expressed as a polynomial
 function of pressure.
 Such function obviously has a derivative:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f'(p)=4\sum_{i}^{n}\alpha_{i}p^{3}+3\sum_{i}^{n}\beta_{i}p^{2}+\sum_{i}^{n}\gamma_{i}\label{pressure root function der}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And can be solved by the Newton method.
 The pressure form other 
\shape italic
Junctions
\shape default
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{other}^{(i)}$
\end_inset

 has to be taken form previous iteration step, therefore all the pressures
 in would need to be computed together.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}$
\end_inset

 might need to be changed sign, in order to indicate if the flow form objects
 is in negative direction relative to the
