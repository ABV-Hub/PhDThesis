Interpretation of some possible fracture collision scenarios.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far the presented formulation offered no restrictions on geometry of
 the model .
 Each edge representing fracture object could be placed anywhere in 2D plane,
 without any particular rules about its position with respect to other objects.
 This should be changed in order to obtain more physical meaning.
 The most urgent restriction to the placement of fractures should be accounting
 for possible edge intersections.
 As a general rule there 
\emph on
should be no fracture grid intersection,
\emph default
 if two edges intersect that indicates a junction should rather be placed
 instead at the intersection point, and the grid points should be relocated.
 Otherwise two separate flow channels would overlap, resulting in obviously
 highly unrealistic formulation.
 While this still might have some reason behind it, if one of the edges
 in question is an 
\emph on
concrete pipe
\emph default
 object this intersection should be ignored, for intersections of other
 type of edges a possibility of fluid flowing in and out of intersecting
 edges must be taken into account.
 There are two ways intersection of edges might be introduced in the model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The initial placement of edges contains intersections.
 Such initial condition for the model would be considered invalid, one should
 provide proper initial problem geometry or fix the initial condition such
 so junctions replace the intersection points..
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When the solution is computed, propagating fracture fronts run into other
 edge.
 This event could have its consequences in creation of new fractures, propagatin
g in new directions, thus rapidly increase complexity of the model geometry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the first type is a trivial problem that should be resolved before
 computation is started, the collisions of propagating fractures must be
 detected during computation, as well as their outcome must be decided.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To detect these collisions any simple line intersection algorithm can be
 used, when each edge is treated as a line segment between the two vertexes
 it connects.
 This requires a number of edges squared intersection tests to be performed,
 but compared to the complexity of the whole problem is not a significant
 number.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When collisions are detected, they can be of one of this types:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
crack to closed fracture, interaction with natural fracture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
crack to other crack or pipe, interaction with another hydraulic fracture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
crack to other junction of crack tip 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third type is a rare scenario since vertexes considered here are of
 point size, nevertheless one can assume that some collisions are of this
 type by assuming some proximity threshold.
 Similar specification of collision types, but for a different multifracturing
 model, was done by Kresse 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kresse2"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strategy used here is to pause if these collisions are detected, apply
 changes to the model to transform intersecting edges into some new meaningful
 structures and then continue computation.
 For all the changes made, there are two practical criteria that arise if
 this model is to be consistent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total amount of fluid in the system before and after collision must
 remain constant:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Vol{}_{before}=Vol{}_{after}\label{eq:colision_constant_volume}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which can be calculated by integrating all openings of all affected edges
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum L\int_{0}^{1}w(x)dx$
\end_inset

.
 This will allow for fluid balance 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "fluid_balance"

\end_inset

 to remain unaffected by the collision.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second criteria comes from junction condition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "constant_pressure"

\end_inset

.
 The strategy used to compute fluid pressure at junctions ensures the same
 value across connected edges, but does not guarantee valid nor relatively
 smooth transition in this value.
 To maintain relatively smooth and continuous 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{f}$
\end_inset

 (reasonable differences over discretized grid), lets assume the value at
 next closest grid points (
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}>0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{N-1}<1$
\end_inset

) is similar:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{fluid}^{(1)}|_{x_{2}\ or\ x_{N-1}}\approx p_{fluid}^{(2)}|_{x_{2}\ or\ x_{N-1}}\approx...\approx p_{fluid}^{(j)}|_{x_{2}\ or\ x_{N-1}}\label{smooth_pressure}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As collisions in this work are expected to force some fluid transfer to
 achieve 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:colision_constant_volume"

\end_inset

, balancing out pressure at the same time 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "smooth_pressure"

\end_inset

 provides a reasonable way of managing this transfer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Crack to Natural Fracture (closed crack)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A good study of interaction between propagating fracture and natural closed
 fracture was presented by Chuprakov in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Chuprakov"

\end_inset

 and Kresse in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kresse2"

\end_inset

.
 Both formulations show well the complexity of the problem, the involved
 parameters include toughness and natural fracture permeability, that are
 not considered in this model.
 Hence developing an extensive model for this type of interactions would
 be a inferior redoing of work that was already done, and the result could
 be easily invalidated by introduction of some new variable or physical
 phenomena.
 A very simplified model should be presented here, that is not meant to
 properly describe the entire physical process, but to rather acts a reliable
 solution for the whole multifracturing model, that produces a meaningful
 result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it is well shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Chuprakov"

\end_inset

, there is a finite number of possible outcomes of fracture to natural fracture
 collision.
 The propagating fracture might open natural closed fractures or continue
 propagating, or both.
 The approach presented here should allow for all of these theoretical outcomes,
 thous add new fracture segments depending of the choice of action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First lets define when an intersection of fracture and closed fracture triggers
 this strategy.
 The collision is considered 
\emph on
if intersection of line segment representation of fracture and closed fracture
 exist and the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 between the point of intersection and crack tip is 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{C}<d<2T_{C}$
\end_inset

.
 
\emph default
The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{C}$
\end_inset

 will represent here some small collision distance detection threshold.
 Under this definition the collision is in fact accepted after propagating
 fracture crosses the natural fracture.
 If this cross distance is grater than 
\begin_inset Formula $2T_{C}$
\end_inset

 the computation proceeded to far, and should revert to previous time step.
 Consequently it can be predicted when a fracture will hit some NF:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
time\ to\ collision\approx\frac{distance\ to\ intersection\ +\frac{3}{2}T_{C}}{V_{0}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which gives yet another usage for speed equation 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 term 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "norm_speed_2"

\end_inset

.
 This criteria for prediction and detection, should be used to adjust time
 steps.
 Once the tip reaches right position, the amount of 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 that makes over HF should be cut of and removed.
 This removed amount counts as before volume in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:colision_constant_volume"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Vol{}_{before}=L_{crack}\int_{1-\frac{d}{L}}^{1}w_{crack}dx\label{eq:v_bef_NF}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now the reminder of initial crack should be translated into a pipe segment.
 The new width of this new pipe would be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w_{pipe}(x)=w_{crack}\left(x\frac{L_{crack}-d}{L_{pipe}}\right)\ x\in(0,1)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since new pipe segment will be shorter by 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 This translation will require some extrapolation, as 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 comes as discretized over some points.
 The process of finding intermittent data points in described in Appendix
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Interpolating-and-Integrating"

\end_inset

 .
 Then the old crack segment is removed form the model and three new segments
 originating from new junction are considered.
 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "crack_to_nf"

\end_inset

) These have respective lengths 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1},L_{2},L_{3}$
\end_inset

and are under influence of stresses 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\sigma_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 For a fracture to remain opened net fluid pressure must be grater than
 experienced stress, thou the condition (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "opening_condition"

\end_inset

) is used to verify that for each considered fracture:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{net}>0\ \rightarrow\ p_{fluid}-\sigma_{o}^{(i)}-\sigma_{l}^{(i)}>0,\ i=1,2,3.\label{NF_condition}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{fluild}$
\end_inset

 is determinate by the value of old fracture at intersection.
 Since for each considered new fractures 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{o}^{(i)},\ \sigma_{l}^{(i)}$
\end_inset

 will have different values, it is possible that all considered new fractures
 can remain, or the fluid pressure might not be enough to open any of these
 new segments, and all of them should be discarded.
 It is possible that a fracture with negative net pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{net}$
\end_inset

 might shield other considered fracture, therefore the condition must be
 checked again if one of the new fractures was discarded.
 Once the number of allowed new segments is found, the width at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 is set
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w^{(i)}(x_{2})=\frac{p_{fluid}-\sigma_{o}^{(i)}-\sigma_{l}^{(i)}}{k},\ i=1,2,3.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For each remaining new fracture.
 Therefore the initial width of these segments might be different, while
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{fluid}$
\end_inset

 remains at relatively the same levels.
 Finally the remaining data points 
\begin_inset Formula $w(x_{3}...x_{N})$
\end_inset

 can be delivered form self similar solution (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "self_similar_linkov"

\end_inset

), as argued in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Initial-condition"

\end_inset

, scaled by a constant factor to obtain the same value at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The remaining values of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1},L_{2},L_{3}$
\end_inset

 can be found such so
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}Vol{}_{after}=L_{1}\int_{0}^{1}w_{new\ crack}^{(1)}dx & +L_{2}\int_{0}^{1}w_{new\ crack}^{(2)}dx\\
 & +L_{3}\int_{0}^{1}w_{new\ crack}^{(3)}dx
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
has the same volume as originally removed part (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:v_bef_NF"

\end_inset

).
 This can be achieved by assuming some simple proportion of volume split
 among opened fractures, say proportional to their relative width 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{w^{(i)}}{w^{(1)}+w^{(2)}+w^{(3)}}$
\end_inset

, and bisection method used on function:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f(L_{(i)})=L_{(i)}\int_{0}^{1}w_{new\ crack}^{(i)}dx-\frac{w^{(i)}}{w^{(1)}+w^{(2)}+w^{(3)}}Vol{}_{before}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The procedure described here will produce an outcome that can be then further
 integrated in time by the model described in this work.
 The only guaranteed property is that it aligns with all the other assumptions
 already made, and does not significantly influences stability or accuracy
 of computation.
 In fact this strategy is designed to fit the best with the rest of the
 model.
 Alternatively it is possible to arbitrary force removal, or addition of
 other segments, as long as non negative net fluid pressure is maintained
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "NF_condition"

\end_inset

).
 The method could potentially be replaced by other, more sophisticated solution
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Chuprakov"

\end_inset

,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kresse2"

\end_inset

) however the outcome should still have to agree with (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:colision_constant_volume"

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "smooth_pressure"

\end_inset

).
 Regardless of strategy used, the process of interaction with natural closed
 fractures is considered as an instant time event, and as long as all possible
 outcomes can theoretically by handled by this model, this method for collisions
 can be used at least as a simplified test procedure.

\begin_layout Subsection
Crack to Hydraulic Fracture (crack or pipe crack)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second probable type of collisions are intersections of propagating
 fracture with another fracture or PKN pipe segment.
 At this moment, despite extensive attempts to find any explanation of this
 phenomena in the literature were failed.
 (definitely nothing as descriptive as sources for hydraulic fracture to
 NF interaction).
 Here again some simplified method that does the task for the purpose of
 simulating the whole model is used.
 The detection of this intersections will be based again on some collision
 acceptance threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{C}$
\end_inset

.
 If the distance form fracture tip, to the intersection with opened hydraulic
 fracture 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is less than threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $|d|<T_{C}$
\end_inset

 the collision is detected (extended projection of crack is used).
 If the fracture collides but, the 
\begin_inset Formula $d>T_{C}$
\end_inset

, overshoot happens, and smaller time step should be used.
 The time to intersection can, again, be predicted using fluid velocity
 :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
time\ to\ collision\approx\frac{distance\ to\ intersection}{V_{0}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When intersection is detected, new junction is created in its place.
 The old crack, and hit pipe or crack is removed form the model, and replaced
 with two new pipe segments and a new crack segment (if hit crack), or three
 new pipe segments (if hit pipe).
 The procedure is the same, regardless of what type of object was hit, it
 is being treated as generic edge.
 The crack will be transformed into new edge 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1}$
\end_inset

, and the hit edge will be split in two new edges 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The volume before is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Vol{}_{before}=L_{old_{\ }crack}\int_{0}^{1}w_{old_{\ }crack}dx+L_{hit_{\ }edge}\int_{0}^{1}w_{hit\ edge}dx\label{eq:v_bef_HF}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the volume after would be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Vol{}_{before}=L_{e_{1}}\int_{0}^{1}w_{e_{1}}dx+L_{e_{2}}\int_{0}^{1}w_{e_{2}}dx+L_{e_{3}}\int_{0}^{1}w_{e_{3}}dx\label{eq:v_aff_HF}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The openings 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{e}$
\end_inset

 of new edges are given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w_{e_{1}}(x)=w_{old_{\ }crack}\left(x\right)\ x\in(0,1)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w_{e_{2}}(x)=w_{hit\ edge}\left(s_{1}x\right)\ x\in(0,1)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w_{e_{3}}(x)=w_{hit\ edge}\left(s_{2}x+s_{1}\right)\ x\in(0,1)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}=\frac{L_{e_{1}}}{L_{e_{1}}+L_{e_{2}}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}=\frac{L_{e_{2}}}{L_{e_{1}}+L_{e_{2}}}$
\end_inset

 are proportional to new edges lengths share in old hit edge 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}+s_{2}=1$
\end_inset

.
 This assignment of crack opening will require some extrapolation of values,
 similarly as needed in NF case.
 This is done with techniques shown in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Interpolating-and-Integrating"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far the volume was changed, as 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1}$
\end_inset

is a result of snapping old crack to attach it at the new intersection.
 Moreover the inherited value of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{net\ e_{1}}(x_{N-1})\approx0$
\end_inset

, as this is the proximity of old crack tip, does not match with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{net_{\ }e_{2}}(x_{N-1})\approx p_{net_{\ }e_{3}}(x_{2})>0$
\end_inset

.
 This creates a jump in fluid pressure value that is likely to destabilize
 either junction strategy (via disturbing newton iterations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "newton root junction"

\end_inset

) or significantly increase problem stiffness.
 To fix this problem, while maintaining same fluid volume a scheme is constructe
d that attempts to transfer some of the volume to meet both conditions (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:colision_constant_volume"

\end_inset

) and (

These are chosen such so most of the fluid volume is transferred near the
 junction.
 Now lets seek values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 used in:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{w_{e_{1}}}(x)=w_{e_{1}}(1+b\varpi_{i}^{(e_{1})})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{w_{e_{2}}}(x)=w_{e_{2}}(1+a\varpi_{i}^{(e_{2})})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{w_{e_{3}}}(x)=w_{e_{2}}(1+a\varpi_{i}^{(e_{3})})
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Such so (

\end_inset

) (

\end_inset

) are satisfied by finding zeros of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f_{1}(a,b)=Vol{}_{before}-L_{e_{1}}\int_{0}^{1}\hat{w_{e_{1}}}dx-L_{e_{2}}\int_{0}^{1}\hat{w_{e_{2}}}dx-L_{e_{3}}\int_{0}^{1}\hat{w_{e_{3}}}dx\label{eq:HF_bisection_1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f_{2}(a,b)=p_{fluid}^{(e_{1})}(x_{N-2})-\frac{p_{fluid}^{(e_{2})}(x_{N-1})+p_{fluid}^{(e_{3})}(x_{2})}{2}\label{eq:v_aff_HF_bisection_2}

\begin_layout Standard
Chained bisection method, one bisection algorithm inscribed into the other,
 can be used to first find the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 that matches 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 for volume 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

, and then check for solution of pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{2}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
The following scheme handles a relatively small volume transfer, compared
 to the volume of involved edges.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $p>1$
\end_inset

 used for weights (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:weigth1"

\end_inset

), (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:weigth2"

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:weigth3"

\end_inset

) , the majority of volume is displaced locally, near the junction.
 It can have a physical interpretation of pressure jump in system resolving
 relatively fast, compared to the other processes.
 However, this modification does not resolve entire pressure drop problem.
