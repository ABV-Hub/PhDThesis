\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Graph like structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets assume that the multifracturing model is a collection of some smaller
 constructs.
 It exists in some horizontal rock layer, that when viewed form the top
 can be interpreted as a two dimensional plane.
 Consequently a number 2D points, 
\emph on
vertices
\emph default
, can be specified.
 Each two 
\emph on
vertices 
\emph default
can be connected by an 
\emph on
edge
\emph default
, consequently making the entire structure a graph.
 Edges and vertices are abstractions to various physical structures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Edge
\emph default
 can be interpreted as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\shape italic
PKN crack
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\shape italic
PKN pipe
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\shape italic
solid pipe
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\shape italic
closed crack
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Vertex
\emph default
 can be thought as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\shape italic
junction
\shape default
 connection points, distributes fluid among connected edges, can act as
 a pump in location (wellbore),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
propagating cracks tip 
\emph default
a movable 
\shape italic
crack
\shape default
 tip location
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
closed cracks tip, 
\emph default
indicates 
\shape italic
crack closed 
\emph on
start or end location
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this abstraction it follows that :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
each vertex can be located by its unique 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y)$
\end_inset

 coordinates (not to be confused with normalized 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{x}$
\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
every vertex is connected to at least one edge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
every edge must connect two vertices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
normal vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{n}$
\end_inset

 to each edge can be obtained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 for edge is the distance between these two connected vertices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
each edge has different orientation, which results in different net backstress
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{o}$
\end_inset

 value
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\shape italic
crack 
\emph on
and 
\emph default
crack pipe 
\emph on
store additional information about the distribution of fluid, and spatial
 discretization (grid type and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

), while 
\emph default
crack pipe 
\emph on
and 
\emph default
crack closed 
\emph on
have no such data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
locations of each edge local 1D grid point 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in global 2D coordinate system can be then consequently derived as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
(x_{i},y_{i})=(x_{1}+L_{x}L\tilde{x},\ y_{1}+L_{y}L\tilde{x})\label{point_location}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where unit vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}=(L_{x},L_{y})$
\end_inset

 shows propagation direction and is perpendicular to edge normal 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Representing model as a graph structure is not necessary from mathematical,
 but highly beneficial form practical computational point of view (some
 other works also suggest this abstract structure interpretation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "network_hf"

\end_inset

).
 This representation allows to couple 1D formulation, into 2D problem, while
 still effectively using 1D to describe each fracture.
 The added dimension is dealt with at higher level, while large amounts
 of single fracture solution can be reused.
 Additionally several issues, such as fracture interactions, rendering or
 actual code quality, will be shown later to be elegantly addressed with
 such structure representation.
 Note that if only one 
\shape italic
junction
\shape default
 and 
\emph on
propagating crack tip 
\emph default
are connected by a
\shape italic
 crack 
\emph on
edge this formulation is equivalent to standard half wing PKN model fracture.

Backstress 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The backstress experienced by each fracture should be based on that fracture
 orientation relative to horizontal stresses in the underground formation.
 It is a common assumption in hydrofracturing problems, as showed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kresse1,BungerPeirce,Wong"

\end_inset

 and , to simply split this experienced stress into two parallel components,
 this should be denoted in this work as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{y}$
\end_inset

.
 The third component 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

 , acting in vertical direction, is ignored as has little influence on existing
 fractures.
 This assumes uniform stress experienced by the underground formation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following relation will be used to find 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

 for each edge:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{0}=|\hat{n}\cdot\sigma_{x}|+|\hat{n}\cdot\sigma_{y}|\label{sigma_0}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{n}$
\end_inset

 is unit normal to that edge.
 As it can be observed from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "poiseulle_multi-1"

\end_inset

, if
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

 is constant along fracture length this term would eventually vanish in
 computations.
 However if 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

 is different for interconnected fractures, then this term must be taken
 into account if the fluid pressure (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "elasticity_multi-1"

\end_inset

) is to be properly compared between these fractures.

PKN crack 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conventional PKN like fracture, as described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Normalized-formulation"

\end_inset

, is used with a number of changes.
 Such a crack is attached to a 
\shape italic
junction
\shape default
 by its inlet and has a
\emph on
 propagating tip
\emph default
, that moves away from its the inlet.
 The computation for PKN crack needs to be slightly updated.
 The old governing equation for PKN model (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "w_system"

\end_inset

) is replaced by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\mathcal{A}_{crack}^{w}=\frac{\partial w}{\partial t}= & \frac{k}{ML^{2}}\left[\frac{1}{3}w_{0}^{3}x\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}+3w^{2}\left(\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\right)^{2}+w^{3}\frac{\partial^{2}w}{\partial x^{2}}\right]\\
 & \frac{1}{ML^{2}}\left[3w^{2}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\frac{\partial\sigma_{l}}{\partial x}+w^{3}\frac{\partial^{2}\sigma_{l}}{\partial x^{2}}\right]-q_{l}
\end{split}

\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{l}$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore the boundary at the inlet (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) should be modified to:

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{fluid}$
\end_inset

 is the fluid pressure the 
\emph on
junction
\emph default
 this 
\emph on

\emph default
 propagates from.
 This formulation does not affect 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 computation, defined by operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}_{w}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "w_DS"

\end_inset

).
 The change applied to operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 still allows to use previously defined proper variable 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 with relative ease:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\mathcal{A}_{crack}^{U}=\frac{\partial U}{\partial t}= & \frac{k}{ML^{2}}\left[xU_{0}\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}+\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}\right)^{2}+3U\frac{\partial^{2}U}{\partial x^{2}}\right]\\
 & +3U^{\frac{2}{3}}\left\{ \frac{1}{ML^{2}}\left[\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}\frac{\partial\sigma_{l}}{\partial x}+U\frac{\partial^{2}\sigma_{l}}{\partial x^{2}}\right]-q_{l}\right\} 
\end{split}
\label{U_system_elast}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore formulation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "U_DS"

\end_inset

) is still available.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 formulation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Omega_DS"

\end_inset

) although could also used, carries an inherited problem with conversion
 form the width integral to actual width of the fracture.
 While this could be managed, it would considerably increase the time needed
 to develop the whole model, thus it should be left for future development.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
PKN pipe

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the boundaries of PKN model, described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:PKN-crack"

\end_inset

, it is possible to consider some fixed length of fracture as a separate
 flow channel.
 Consequently this would results in a new system where we seek to find pipe
 width 
\begin_inset Formula $w(x,t)$
\end_inset

 with initial conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w(0,x)=w_{*}(x),\quad x\in(0,1),\label{pipe_initial}
\end{equation}

and boundary conditions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
w(0,t) & = & \frac{1}{k}\left[p_{fulid}^{(x=0)}-\sigma_{0}-\sigma_{l}(0,t)\right]\label{pipe_boundary}\\
w(1,t) & = & \frac{1}{k}\left[p_{fulid}^{(x=1)}-\sigma_{0}-\sigma_{l}(1,t)\right]

 This condition at 
\begin_inset Formula $w(1,t)$
\end_inset

 is much easier to deal with than the previous zero opening at crack tip
 condition (

\end_inset

), thus there will be no need for special BC conditions or 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The governing equation is similar to result obtained in normal PKN pipe
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This governing equation has much smoother behavior than the previous for
 crack segment (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "w_system_elast"

\end_inset

) , as the fracture tip and its singularity is no longer exist.
 Just like in previous case the proper dependent variable 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 can be introduced:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial U}{\partial t}=\frac{k}{3ML^{2}}\left[\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}\right)^{2}+3U\frac{\partial^{2}U}{\partial x^{2}}\right]-3U^{\frac{2}{3}}q_{l}\label{pipe_reynolds_U}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally when the effect of neighboring fractures 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{l}$
\end_inset

 is included the governing equation becomes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}\mathcal{A}_{pipe}^{w}=\frac{\partial w}{\partial t}= & \frac{k}{ML^{2}(t)}\left[3w^{2}\left(\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\right)^{2}+w^{3}\frac{\partial^{2}w}{\partial x^{2}}\right]\\
 & +\frac{1}{ML^{2}(t)}\left[3w^{2}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\frac{\partial\sigma_{l}}{\partial x}+w^{3}\frac{\partial^{2}\sigma_{l}}{\partial x^{2}}\right]-q_{l}
\end{split}
\label{w_system_elast_pipe}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Solid pipe and Closed Crack
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is reasonable to assume that there might be some fixed flow channels,
 such as man made horizontal concrete pipes.
 These 
\shape italic
solid pipe
\shape default
 segments are assumed to have circular cross-section, direct application
 of Poiseuille's Law in the simplest form can be made:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Q=\frac{\Delta p_{fluid}\pi R^{4}}{8\mu L}\label{poiseuille law}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Where variable 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is the flow rate, and length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and radios 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 are constant.
 The term

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p_{fluid}$

 is the difference between fluid pressure at two junctions this

connects.
 thus the flow rate might take negative or positive values, depending on
 the direction of the flow.
 This assumes laminar flow in these solid pipe connections, but the PKN
 model itself is based on a non turbulent flow assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Closed cracks are preexisting fractures.
 This type of fractures is assumed to be closed by the confining pressure,
 but might be opened by the fracturing fluid.
 These have zero width, and exist as "markers" that may change the path
 of propagation of existing fractures.
 Each closed crack spams between two 
\emph on
closed cracks tips, 
\emph default
or if it was reached, but not opened by the fracturing fluid, , between
 a 
\emph on
closed tip
\emph default
 and a 
\emph on
junction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It could be assumed, as it follows (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "elasticity_multi-1"

\end_inset

), that this fracture will remain closed as long as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{fluid}\leqq\sigma_{o}+\sigma_{l}\label{opening_condition}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang american
Thou there can be a number of other factors that should be taken into account.
 However ensuring that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{net}>0$
\end_inset

 for a fracture to open is necessary for the computations, as well as can
 be logically explained.
